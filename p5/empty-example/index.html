      <P id="myP">I realized while recording the solution to HW 3 a few things that I didn't cover in the lecture that will be helpful to know. After submitting a blog post, I ask you to redirect to a permalink for that post. The url format might look something like this: /blog/1001, where 1001 is the id of the post you just submitted.</P>
